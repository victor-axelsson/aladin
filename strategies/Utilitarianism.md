## Strategy 2: The Precise Reformist

**Ethical Premise:**  
Utilitarianism, modified by the precautionary principle.

### Steps

1. **Wish 1:**  
   Wish that *“acts intended to harm others are rendered non-executable, except in clearly consensual training or sport contexts.”*

2. **Wish 2:**  
   Wish that *“humans are slightly predisposed to value restorative justice and forgiveness — without removing their sense of accountability or fairness.”*

3. **Wish 3:**  
   Include a self-corrective mechanism, such as:  
   *“I wish for a globally distributed council, drawn by lottery, empowered to nullify these wishes by supermajority vote.”*

### Game Theory Note  
This is a **minimax strategy** — minimizing the maximum potential harm  
by structuring wishes narrowly and building in safeguards for reversibility.
