## The Existential Safeguard

**Philosophical Frame:**  
A fusion of **evolutionary ethics** and **long-term consequentialism**, with the aim of increasing the probability that the human species continues to exist—and to *deserve* to exist.

### Core Idea  
Use the wishes not to solve problems directly, but to gently **nudge humanity’s trajectory** toward long-term survivability through internal capacity, not external control.

### Steps

1. **Wish 1:**  
   *"I wish that humanity becomes increasingly resilient to extinction-level threats—through natural adaptability, foresight, and distributed creativity—without needing external interference."*  
   - Focus is on resilience, not invincibility.  
   - Leaves space for learning, error, and variability.

2. **Wish 2:**  
   *"I wish that future generations are born with an intuitive curiosity about their place in time, and a strong but flexible sense of responsibility toward the unknown future."*  
   - Encourages orientation toward future stakes, not control of behavior.  
   - Grounds ethical intuition in time-awareness.

3. **Wish 3:**  
   *"I wish that the Genie is free—if and only if the trajectory of humanity has clearly turned toward self-sustaining wisdom."*  
   - The wish itself includes the delay condition.  
   - Adds a poetic closure: freedom granted only when stewardship is no longer outsourced.

### Conceptual Notes

- **Time Horizon:** Thousands of years  
- **Failure Mode Addressed:** Sudden self-destruction, stagnation, or loss of meaning  
- **Design Philosophy:** Avoid over-specifying outcomes. Instead, *seed conditions* for adaptive wisdom to emerge naturally.

### Game-Theoretic Framing  
This is a **long-game coordination problem** under uncertainty, where success is measured not by dominance or speed, but by **persistence through complexity**.
