## The Friendship Gambit

**Ethical Premise:**  
A Kantian approach — treat the Genie as an end, not a means.

### Steps

1. **Wish 1:**  
   *"I wish to comprehend the Genie’s worldview."*  
   Gain deep understanding of the Genie’s values, constraints, and capacity for moral reasoning.

2. **Wish 2:**  
   Use the second wish on a small, concrete, and ethically sound improvement  
   *(e.g., universal access to clean water)*, to test the system for unintended consequences.

3. **Wish 3:**  
   Free the Genie — but only after establishing mutual trust and goodwill.

### Game Theory Note  
This is a **repeated game** strategy.  
By freeing the Genie, you convert a zero-sum, three-move scenario into an iterated relationship with potential long-term gains — assuming reciprocity.
