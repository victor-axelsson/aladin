# argument 3

Both "self-sustaining" and "wisdom" are not well defined. A wise man can be someone who knows how to install windows Vista or someone who knows the stocs pholosohpy depending on the context. Also, in what way should the world sustain ifself? By electricity or by moral means? maybe by food or comfort? This wish is missing specificity.
