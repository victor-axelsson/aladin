## Strategy 3: The Institutionalist

**Ethical Premise:**  
Rawlsian justice with game-theoretic governance design.

### Steps

1. **Wish 1:**  
   Wish for the global creation of a philosophically grounded deliberative assembly,  
   composed of randomly selected citizens trained in ethics and decision-making,  
   to review wish consequences.

2. **Wish 2:**  
   Wish for enhanced moral reasoning capacities across the population —  
   not to make people good, but to make them better at thinking about what “good” means.

3. **Wish 3:**  
   Free the Genie — **if and only if** the deliberative body concludes it is both safe and right to do so.

### Game Theory Note  
This turns a personal wish scenario into a **mechanism design** problem.  
The strategy transfers the power of the wishes into an institution with legitimacy and distributed checks,  
reducing the risks of autocratic or miscalculated choices.
