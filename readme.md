# About

I recently watched *Disney's Aladdin* with my kids, and together we encountered the Genie. This raised an ethical dilemma:

- You rub the lamp.
- You get 3 wishes.

### There are rules:

1. You cannot make someone love you.  
2. You cannot wish for more wishes.  
3. You cannot revive someone from the dead.

### Implicit game-playing constraints:

1. You can wish for the Genie to be free.  
2. Generalized wishes like "make everything good" tend to backfire.

# Game Strategies

You will find the strategies in the "strategies" folder

You can retaliate with counter arguments in the "counter aguments" folder.

## General approach

1. Make the Genie like you before using all 3 wishes. Free himâ€”and potentially gain a lifelong friend who grants informal wishes.  
2. Alternatively, do something and hope that the Genie will like you after you free him.

# Frowned upon

In this collaborative effort and I am the dictator. I will frown upon thes following things:

- Copy paste from religion
- Copy paste from philisophy
- Cliches, memes, slapstick, populisitic agendas to win moral highground
- More tings that have not yet become a problem

# Merged changes

I will merge things that

- I don't necessarily agree with but that have solid arguments
- Have an innovative argument
- Brings diversity to the discussion
- Is both diverse and usefull, e.i serendipity, to the discussion

But primarilly...

- Shows on logical flaws in discussion and proposed discussions and strategies
