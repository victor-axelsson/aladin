# About

Ok, so I watched Disneys Aladin with my kids and we met the genier toghther. We had an ethical dilema. 

1, You rub them lamp
2, You have 3 wishes

There are rules

1, You cannot make someone love you
2, You cannot wish for more wishes
3, You cannot revieve someone from the dead

In addition to this there some implcicit game playing issues:

1, You can wish the gienie to be free
2, Generalizations sush as "make all things good" genelrally backfire

# Game stratergies
In this secition we propose the strategies for working the genie.

## Strategy nr 1
1, You make the genie like you beofre 3 wishes, free him and and have unlimited informal wishes as a friend. 

2, You wish that the genie like you after you free him.

## Strategy X
[open for suggestions]

# Wish suggestions

1, You wish that all people are incapable of violence of all kinds (physical as non-physical).

2, You wish that all people rate fogiveness over actions.

3, Free the genie when he likes you well enough to serve your lifetime

## Argument against

## Counter argument 1
[1] 1, If all people are incapable of violence there is no final resort to abuse. 

[1] 2, It it agains our human nature as a sophisticated monkey to not train for violence. All exercise, sush as boxing, MMA and thai boxing will lead to even more passiveness. Something that is not good for our bodies. 

## Counter argument 2

[2] 1, If all actions are replaced by forgiveness we will forgive things that should not acceptable. People will abuse the forgivness and do whatever they want. 

[2] 2, People have an inherrit need for justice. If things are forgiven lightly they will not live a good live. 

## Counter agurment 3

[3] 1, What if the genie is not a good person. Meybe the genie will spend all of its reminding days to torment us. 

[3] 2, What if the genie does not posess any power after its released. 

### Counter counter argument 3
[3] [2] - Does it matter? You still made a good friend without an ulterier motive? 


# Frowned upon

In this collaborative effort and I am the dictator. I will frown upon thes following things:

- Copy paste from religion
- Copy paste from philisophy
- Cliches, memes, slapstick, populisitic agendas to win moral highground
- More tings that have not yet become a problem

# Promoted

- Logistic proofs
- Specificity over abstraction
- Good discussion
- Game theory (and etensions thereof)
